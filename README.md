# SMS-Spam-Detection
SMS Spam Detection is a final year project undertaken by aspiring CS students, Ibrahim Irfan and Bilal Ahmed in association with University of Lahore.
In this project, first we collected a range of datasets related to SMS Spams and Hams. Once our data collection was complete, we created an SRS report, 
that briefly highlights our project scope, technical requirements, tools and technologies to be used throughout the implementation of our project and
deliverables as well as the schedule of our project implementation and delivery. Once all our project implementation was complete, we wrote an 80 page
thesis on our project, which highlights all the research we did during the commencement of our project, the tools and technologies that were used, all the
work and tasks that were completed and what goals was accomplished during the implementation of our project. In the end we also measured what other work we
will be doing on future versions of our project.
